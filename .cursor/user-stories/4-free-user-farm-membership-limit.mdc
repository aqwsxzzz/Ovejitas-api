As a system administrator, I want to limit free users to a maximum of 2 farm memberships (either as owner or member) so that we can implement a freemium model with basic limitations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Farm Membership Limits
- Free users can be members of maximum 2 farms
- This limit applies to both farm ownership and membership roles
- The limit is enforced during:
  - Initial farm creation during signup
  - Accepting farm invitations
  - Creating new farms
  - Being added to farms by other users

### User Experience
- Users should be notified when they reach their farm membership limit
- Users should see how many farm slots they have remaining
- Users should receive clear error messages when trying to exceed their limit
- The UI should prevent users from creating or joining farms when at their limit

### System Behavior
- The system should track the number of farm memberships per user
- The system should enforce the limit before any new farm membership is created
- The system should allow users to leave farms to free up slots
- The system should prevent users from being added to new farms when at their limit

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages when:
  - User tries to create a farm when at their limit
  - User tries to accept an invitation when at their limit
  - Another user tries to add a user who is at their limit
  - User tries to join a farm when at their limit

### Validation
- The system should validate farm membership count before:
  - Creating new farms
  - Accepting invitations
  - Adding users to farms
  - Creating farm memberships
