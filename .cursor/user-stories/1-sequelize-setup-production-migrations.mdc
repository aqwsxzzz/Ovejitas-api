As a developer, I want the Sequelize setup to be production-ready and avoid using `sync`, so that all database schema changes are managed safely and reproducibly through migrations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Sequelize is initialized without using `sequelize.sync()` in any environment.
- All database schema changes (tables, columns, indexes, etc.) are performed exclusively via Sequelize migrations.
- There is a clear process for running migrations in development, staging, and production.
- Documentation exists for how to create, run, and revert migrations.
- The setup is compatible with CI/CD pipelines and does not require manual intervention for schema updates.
- No business logic or schema changes are performed outside of migrations.
