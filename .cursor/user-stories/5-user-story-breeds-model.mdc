As a developer, I want admin users to be able to manage (add, edit, and remove) animal breeds in the database so that end users can select the correct breed when creating animal records.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin users can add new breeds, each associated with a specific species.
- Breed names must be unique per species (e.g., "Angus" for cattle, "Yorkshire" for pigs).
- Admin users can edit existing breed names and their associated species.
- Admin users can remove breeds from the database.
- Each breed record includes:
  - id (int, PK)
  - species_id (int, FK â†’ SPECIES.id)
  - name (string, unique per species)
  - created_at (datetime)
  - updated_at (datetime)
- End users can select from the list of breeds (but not modify them) when creating animal records.
