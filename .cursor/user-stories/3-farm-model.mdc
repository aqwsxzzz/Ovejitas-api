As a registered user, I want to have a personal farm (workspace) created for me by default upon my first login, so that I can immediately start managing my resources and later invite other users to collaborate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new farm is automatically created for every user upon their first login.
- The user is assigned as the owner of their default farm.
- Users can view and manage their farm (e.g., update farm details, manage resources).
- Users can invite other users to join their farm as collaborators.
- All resources (e.g., animals, assets, data) are associated with a farm, not directly with a user.
- Users can see a list of members in their farm.
- If a user is invited to another farm, they can switch between farms they belong to.
- The system supports multiple users per farm for future collaboration features.
- The user experience is seamless: the farm is ready to use immediately after login, with no manual setup required.
