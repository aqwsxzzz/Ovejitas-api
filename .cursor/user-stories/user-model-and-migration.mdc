As a developer, I want to create a user model and migration with validated fields so that user data is stored securely and consistently in the database.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User model and migration exist in the correct folders (`src/models/`, `src/migrations/`)
- All fields are present:
  - `displayName` (string, required)
  - `email` (string, required, unique, valid email format)
  - `password` (string, required, hashed)
  - `createdAt` (date, auto-generated)
  - `updatedAt` (date, auto-generated)
  - `isActive` (boolean, default: true)
  - `role` (string, e.g., 'user', 'admin', optional)
- `email` is unique and validated for proper format
- `password` is required and stored as a hash (not plain text)
- Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are automatically managed
- Zod schema exists for user creation and update, validating all fields
- Migration creates the correct table and constraints
- Model and validation are covered by at least one test
