# Cursor Rule: User Stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

## User Story Format

**All user stories must be created as individual files inside the `.cursor/user-stories` directory.**

Each user story should follow this template:

```
As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.
```

### Example

```
As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Each user story must include clear acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete. Use bullet points or a checklist.
Each new user story should start with a number, following the order of **.cursor/user-stores** folder.

### Example

-   User can request a password reset link via email
-   User receives a reset link that expires in 1 hour
-   User can set a new password using the link
-   User is notified of success or failure

## Best Practices

-   **Create each user story as a separate file in `.cursor/user-stories`**
-   Focus on the user's needs and value
-   Keep stories small and actionable
-   Avoid technical details in the story itself (put those in tasks or subtasks)
-   Write acceptance criteria that are clear, testable, and unambiguous
-   Collaborate with stakeholders to refine stories

## Anti-Patterns

-   Avoid stories that are too large (split them if needed)
-   Avoid vague acceptance criteria
-   Avoid technical implementation details in the story description
