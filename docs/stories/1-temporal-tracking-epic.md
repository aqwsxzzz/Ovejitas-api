# Epic 1: Temporal Animal Tracking System

## Epic ID: 1
## Priority: High
## Target Release: v2.0

## Epic Overview
Implement a comprehensive temporal tracking system for farm animals that maintains historical records of measurements, health, location, breeding, finances, and group assignments while preserving current system performance.

## Business Value
- Enable data-driven decision making through historical trend analysis
- Improve animal health outcomes with better tracking
- Increase profitability through financial visibility
- Streamline breeding program management
- Reduce manual record-keeping time by 50%

## Scope
### In Scope
1. **Animal Measurements** - Track weight, height, body condition over time
2. **Health Records** - Vaccinations, treatments, examinations, illnesses
3. **Location History** - Movement between pastures, barns, facilities
4. **Breeding Events** - Breeding, pregnancy, birth records
5. **Financial Records** - Costs, revenues, ROI per animal
6. **Group Assignments** - Herd/flock management history
7. **Data Migration** - Preserve existing data in new structure
8. **Analytics Views** - Summary dashboards and reports

### Out of Scope
- Mobile application (Phase 3)
- Third-party integrations (Phase 3)
- Advanced predictive analytics
- Multi-farm data aggregation

## Technical Approach
- Hybrid architecture: Current state + temporal tables
- PostgreSQL with proper indexing and partitioning
- Virtual fields instead of GENERATED columns (Sequelize compatibility)
- Phased migration to minimize risk

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Critical)
- Animal measurements tracking
- Basic health records
- Data migration from existing weight fields
- Virtual field implementation

### Phase 2: Extended Features (Important)
- Full health record management
- Location tracking
- Breeding management
- Financial tracking
- Group assignments

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Nice-to-have)
- Analytics dashboard
- Batch operations
- Mobile app support
- Third-party integrations

## Success Criteria
1. All existing functionality preserved
2. Zero data loss during migration
3. Query performance maintained or improved
4. 50% reduction in record-keeping time
5. Improved animal health outcomes measurable within 6 months

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Performance degradation with large datasets
   - **Mitigation**: Implement partitioning and proper indexing from start

2. **Risk**: Complex migration could cause data issues
   - **Mitigation**: Phased approach with rollback capability

3. **Risk**: User adoption challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain familiar UI, add features gradually

## Dependencies
- Current animal management system
- PostgreSQL database
- Existing authentication/authorization
- Farm structure and membership system

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot break existing API contracts
- Must follow established coding standards
- Performance must not degrade
