# Story 1.3: Basic Health Records

## Story ID: 1.3
## Epic: 1 - Temporal Animal Tracking System
## Priority: High (Phase 1)
## Points: 8

## User Story
As a farm manager, I want to record basic health events for my animals so that I can track their medical history and ensure timely vaccinations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Record Health Events**
   - Record vaccinations with vaccine name, batch, date
   - Record examinations with health status
   - Record basic treatments with medication
   - Add veterinarian name and notes
   - Track who recorded the event

2. **Vaccination Management**
   - Set next due date for vaccinations
   - View upcoming vaccinations
   - See vaccination history per animal

3. **Health Status Tracking**
   - Current health status (healthy, sick, injured, recovering)
   - Temperature recordings during examinations
   - General notes and observations

4. **View Health History**
   - See all health records for an animal
   - Filter by record type
   - Sort by date (newest first)

## Technical Requirements

### Database Migration
```javascript
// 20250111000001-create-animal-health-records-table.js
// Create animal_health_records table
// Include indexes for due dates and queries
```

### Models & Types
```typescript
// src/types/animal-health-record-types.ts
- AnimalHealthRecordAttributes
- AnimalHealthRecordCreationAttributes
- IAnimalHealthRecordCreateBody
- Record type enums: 'vaccination' | 'treatment' | 'examination' | 'illness'

// src/models/animal-health-record-model.ts
- Follow model patterns
- Handle different record types
```

### Update Associations
```typescript
// src/models/associations.ts
AnimalHealthRecord.belongsTo(Animal, { foreignKey: "animalId", as: "animal" });
AnimalHealthRecord.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: "performedBy", as: "performer" });
Animal.hasMany(AnimalHealthRecord, { foreignKey: "animalId", as: "healthRecords" });
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST   /v1/farms/:farmId/animals/:animalId/health-records
GET    /v1/farms/:farmId/animals/:animalId/health-records
GET    /v1/farms/:farmId/animals/:animalId/health-records/:recordId
GET    /v1/farms/:farmId/health-records/upcoming-vaccinations
```

### Virtual Field Updates
```typescript
// Update animal-model.ts
lastHealthCheckDate: {
  type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,
  async get() {
    const record = await AnimalHealthRecord.findOne({
      where: { 
        animalId: this.id,
        recordType: 'examination'
      },
      order: [['recordedAt', 'DESC']]
    });
    return record?.recordedAt || null;
  }
},
nextVaccinationDate: {
  type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,
  async get() {
    const record = await AnimalHealthRecord.findOne({
      where: { 
        animalId: this.id,
        nextDueDate: { [Op.gte]: new Date() }
      },
      order: [['nextDueDate', 'ASC']]
    });
    return record?.nextDueDate || null;
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- Single table for all health record types
- Use record_type to differentiate
- JSONB field for attachments/documents
- Consider temperature units (C/F)
- Due dates only for vaccinations

## Schema Validation
Different validation based on record_type:
- Vaccination: requires vaccine_name, vaccination_date
- Examination: allows temperature, health_status
- Treatment: requires treatment_name, medication

## Testing Requirements
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Different record type validations
   - Temperature range constraints
   - Date validations

2. **Integration Tests**
   - CRUD operations for each record type
   - Upcoming vaccinations query
   - Virtual field updates

## Dependencies
- Animal model exists
- Story 1.2 for virtual field pattern

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database migration created
- [ ] Models handle all record types
- [ ] API endpoints functional
- [ ] Virtual fields for health data working
- [ ] Upcoming vaccinations endpoint works
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Schema validation per record type
