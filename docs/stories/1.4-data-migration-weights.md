# Story 1.4: Data Migration - Existing Weights

## Story ID: 1.4
## Epic: 1 - Temporal Animal Tracking System
## Priority: High (Phase 1)
## Points: 5

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing animal weight data to the new measurement system so that historical data is preserved and accessible in the new structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Data Preservation**
   - All existing weight values migrated to animal_measurements
   - Use animal's updated_at as measurement date
   - Mark migrated records with special note
   - No data loss during migration

2. **Dual-Write Period**
   - New weights save to both old and new structure
   - Existing API continues to work
   - No breaking changes for clients

3. **Rollback Capability**
   - Can rollback migration if issues found
   - Original weight column remains untouched
   - Clear rollback procedure documented

4. **Verification**
   - Count of migrated records matches source
   - Weight values match exactly
   - Virtual fields return same values as before

## Technical Requirements

### Migration Script
```javascript
// 20250111000002-migrate-existing-weight-data.js
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // Insert existing weights into animal_measurements
    await queryInterface.sequelize.query(`
      INSERT INTO animal_measurements (
        animal_id, 
        measurement_type, 
        value, 
        unit, 
        measured_at, 
        notes,
        created_at,
        updated_at
      )
      SELECT 
        id,
        'weight',
        weight,
        'kg',
        COALESCE(updated_at, created_at),
        'Migrated from existing data',
        NOW(),
        NOW()
      FROM animals 
      WHERE weight IS NOT NULL
    `);
  },
  
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    // Remove migrated records
    await queryInterface.sequelize.query(`
      DELETE FROM animal_measurements 
      WHERE notes = 'Migrated from existing data'
    `);
  }
};
```

### Dual-Write Implementation
```typescript
// Update animal-controller.ts createAnimal and updateAnimal
if (body.weight) {
  // Continue saving to animal.weight for now
  animal.weight = body.weight;
  
  // Also create measurement record
  await AnimalMeasurement.create({
    animalId: animal.id,
    measurementType: 'weight',
    value: body.weight,
    unit: 'kg',
    measuredAt: new Date(),
    measuredBy: request.userId
  });
}
```

### Trigger for Sync
```sql
-- Add to migration
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_weight_to_animal()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.measurement_type = 'weight' THEN
    UPDATE animals 
    SET weight = NEW.value, updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE id = NEW.animal_id;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_sync_weight
  AFTER INSERT ON animal_measurements
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_weight_to_animal();
```

## Verification Queries
```sql
-- Count comparison
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animals WHERE weight IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animal_measurements WHERE notes = 'Migrated from existing data';

-- Value comparison
SELECT a.id, a.weight as old_weight, am.value as new_weight
FROM animals a
LEFT JOIN animal_measurements am ON a.id = am.animal_id 
  AND am.measurement_type = 'weight'
WHERE a.weight IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY a.id;
```

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep original weight column (don't drop)
2. Document rollback SQL in migration
3. Test rollback in staging first
4. Have verification queries ready

## Testing Requirements
1. **Pre-Migration**
   - Backup current data
   - Test on copy of production data
   - Verify counts match

2. **Post-Migration**
   - All weights migrated correctly
   - Virtual fields return correct values
   - Existing APIs still work
   - Dual-write functioning

3. **Performance**
   - Migration completes in reasonable time
   - No blocking of normal operations

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 completed (animal_measurements table exists)
- Story 1.2 completed (virtual fields ready)
