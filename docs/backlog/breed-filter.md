# Filter Breeds by Species

**User Story:**  
As a user,  
I want to filter breeds by species when viewing or selecting breeds,  
so that I only see relevant breed options for the species I'm working with.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

-   `/breed` endpoint supports `speciesId` as a filter and returns only relevant breeds.
-   API documentation (Bruno) is updated to reflect the new filter.
-   Unit and integration tests cover this scenario.

**Status:** To Do
