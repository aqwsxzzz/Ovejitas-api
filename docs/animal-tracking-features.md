# Animal Tracking System - Feature Enhancement List

## Overview
Current system tracks animals with basic attributes (species, breed) as simple columns. This document outlines required features to enable comprehensive farm management with historical tracking capabilities.

## Core Data Model Enhancements

### 1. Historical Tracking System
**Problem**: Attributes like weight, health status, and location are stored as single values, losing historical data.

**Required Features:**
- Implement temporal data tables for time-series attributes
- Create audit/history tables for key animal metrics
- Enable "point-in-time" queries for any date

**Affected Attributes:**
- Weight measurements
- Health status changes
- Location movements
- Vaccination records
- Production metrics (milk yield, egg count, etc.)

### 2. Medical Records Module
**Features Needed:**
- Vaccination schedule management with reminders
- Medical history with treatment records
- Veterinary visit logging
- Medication tracking
- Health alert system

### 3. Breeding Management System
**Features Needed:**
- Lineage tracking (parent-child relationships)
- Breeding cycle management
- Pregnancy tracking with due date calculations
- Breeding performance analytics
- Genetic trait tracking

### 4. Financial Tracking
**Features Needed:**
- Purchase/acquisition cost recording
- Feed cost allocation per animal
- Medical expense tracking
- Revenue tracking (sales, production)
- ROI calculations per animal

### 5. Group Management
**Features Needed:**
- Dynamic herd/flock assignment
- Group-based operations (vaccinations, feeding)
- Movement tracking between groups
- Group performance comparisons

## Technical Requirements

### Data Architecture Changes
1. **Event Sourcing Pattern** for historical data
   - Each change creates an immutable event record
   - Current state derived from event history

2. **Separate Tables for Temporal Data**
   ```
   animal_weights {
     id, animal_id, weight, measured_at, measured_by
   }
   
   animal_locations {
     id, animal_id, location_id, moved_at, moved_by
   }
   ```

3. **Polymorphic Medical Records**
   - Flexible schema for various medical event types
   - Attachments support for documents/images

### API Enhancements
- Bulk operations for group updates
- Historical data queries with date ranges
- Aggregation endpoints for analytics
- Real-time notifications for critical events

### User Interface Requirements
- Timeline view for individual animals
- Bulk data entry forms
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Mobile-friendly for field use
- Offline capability with sync

## Priority Ranking

### Phase 1 (Critical)
1. Historical weight tracking
2. Basic medical records
3. Group assignments

### Phase 2 (Important)
1. Full breeding management
2. Financial tracking
3. Advanced medical features

### Phase 3 (Nice-to-have)
1. Analytics dashboard
2. Mobile app
3. Third-party integrations

## Migration Strategy
- Preserve existing single-value fields
- Create migration scripts for historical data
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backwards compatibility

## Success Metrics
- Reduce time spent on record-keeping by 50%
- Improve animal health outcomes through better tracking
- Enable data-driven breeding decisions
- Provide clear ROI visibility per animal
